# Motivation

I am a senior undergrad student at Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS) in Colombia. As an undergrad, I have been working for a year in the high-dimensional signal processing (HDSP) research group. In projects related to deep learning and autoencoder architectures applied in spectral image and video processing. Some of them have been published at IEEE conferences. I believe that this background will be a good starting point to achieve the goals of the project.  
I'm sure that I can acquire an enormous amount of knowledge from your mentorship that I will share with my colleagues at UIS.  I'm passionate about science, especially in applied maths. For the above, I think I could be a suitable option for the GSoC program. Finally, I'm a free software enthusiast. However, I didn't know how to engage in an free or open-source project that matches my research interest, but GSoC is an excellent opportunity to start making contributions to the open-source community.
